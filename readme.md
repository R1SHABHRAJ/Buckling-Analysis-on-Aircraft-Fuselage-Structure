# Buckling Analysis on Aircraft Fuselage Structure

This repository contains the CAD models of the parts made of **Aluminium 6106 T6** such as frames, stringers, and grids. We used **CATIA V5** software to create these models. Following that, we underwent Finite Element Analysis on **ANSYS** while taking into account all aspects including hoop stress, pressurisation, and other boundary conditions. We created a fuselage with grids that are rectangular in shape. Additionally, we have demonstrated how structural characteristics like as skin thickness, grids, and pressure can cause variations in buckling. We have used ANSYS to show equivalent stress, equivalent elastic strain, total deformation, eigenvalue buckling and directional deformation under eigenvalue bucking. We have also shown the fixed support and Pressure variations in the fuselage on the static structural model using ANSYS.

## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to perform a buckling analysis on an aircraft fuselage structure. The fuselage structure is made up of frames, stringers, and grids that are rectangular in shape. The material used for the structure is **Aluminium 6106 T6**.

## CAD Models

We used **CATIA V5** software to create CAD models of the parts made of Aluminium 6106 T6 such as frames, stringers, and grids.

## Finite Element Analysis

We underwent Finite Element Analysis on **ANSYS** while taking into account all aspects including hoop stress, pressurisation, and other boundary conditions.

## Buckling Analysis

We created a fuselage with grids that are rectangular in shape. Additionally, we have demonstrated how structural characteristics like as skin thickness, grids, and pressure can cause variations in buckling.

## Results

We have used ANSYS to show equivalent stress, equivalent elastic strain, total deformation, eigenvalue buckling and directional deformation under eigenvalue bucking. We have also shown the fixed support and Pressure variations in the fuselage on the static structural model using ANSYS.

## Conclusion

This project has demonstrated how structural characteristics like as skin thickness, grids, and pressure can cause variations in buckling. The results obtained from ANSYS show equivalent stress, equivalent elastic strain, total deformation, eigenvalue buckling and directional deformation under eigenvalue bucking.
